# 🏡 House Rent Prediction - Mini Project
👋 Welcome to this machine learning project focused on predicting monthly house rent using regression techniques!

## 📝 Project Overview
In this project, we use a real-world dataset containing features of residential rental properties, such as:

Location

Size (BHK, square footage, etc.)

Furnishing Status

Number of Bathrooms

Tenant Preferences

City and Area Type

Our objective is to develop a complete machine learning pipeline—from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training and evaluation—to predict the rental cost of a house.

## 🎯 Objective
The primary goal is to build and evaluate multiple regression models to accurately predict the monthly rent of a residential property.

This is useful for:

Property listing platforms to display suggested rent

Real estate agents for price recommendations

Tenants and landlords for price benchmarking and fair rental decisions

Analysts to identify trends across cities and property types

## 🤖 Models Evaluated
The following regression algorithms were explored and compared:

Multiple Linear Regression

Polynomial Regression

Support Vector Regression (SVR)

Random Forest Regressor

Tuned Random Forest Regressor

XGBoost Regressor

These models help us uncover both linear and non-linear patterns in rental pricing.

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
Model performance is assessed using the following standard regression metrics:

MAE (Mean Absolute Error) – Average absolute difference between predicted and actual rents

MSE (Mean Squared Error) – Penalizes larger errors

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) – Measures overall model error in real rent units

These metrics provide a robust measure of how well each model performs on unseen data.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
This project was developed using Python, and the following libraries were used:

pandas – Data manipulation

numpy – Numerical operations

matplotlib & seaborn – Data visualization and exploration

scikit-learn – Model building, preprocessing, and evaluation

xgboost – High-performance gradient boosting

scipy – For model tuning and optimization

## ✅ Outcome
Through this project, we aim to:

Identify the best-performing regression model for house rent prediction

Understand the impact of key features such as furnishing, number of bedrooms, and location on rent

Provide insights and tools that support better rental decision-making in the real estate industry

Build a predictive system that can be used for automated rent estimation

💡 Thank you for exploring this project! It showcases how machine learning can be used to bring clarity, fairness, and efficiency to the rental housing market.
